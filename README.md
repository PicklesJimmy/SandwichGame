# Sandwich Maker Game Project 

## Project Description - What is my Project?    

Hello and welcome to my Sandwich Maker Game. This project will be about a game where you are able to costumize your own sandwich. The gameplay will involve the player being able to pick the ingredients/filling for their sandwich, and personalize the qualities regarding each of the ingredients in their sandwich.  

## Project Description - Who Will Use my Project?  

Although my project can be played by anyone, my main target audience are:  
- Kids from the age 7 to 12.  
- Teenagers from the age 13 to 18.  

## Project Description - Why Make a Sandwich Simulator Game?  

I chose to make a sandwich simulator game for my project since I have always enjoyed playing restaurant/cooking simulation games when I was little. In fact, even now, I still enjoy a lot of restaurant simulator games such as **Overcooked 2**. Consequently, I want to make my project around the idea of restaurant simulator games out of passion and my love for the genre.
