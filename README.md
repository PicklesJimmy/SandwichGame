# Sandwich Maker Game Project 

## Project Description - What is my Project?    

Hello and welcome to my Sandwich Maker Game. This project will be about a game where you work as an employee at a sandwich restaurant. The gameplay will involve the player being tasked with serving customers with their sandwiches of desire. If they are able to serve the customers with the correct order, then they are able to proceed into the next day and continue the game. However, if the player serves the wrong sandwich, they will get fired from their job and lose the game as a result.  

## Project Description - Who Will Use my Project?  

Although my project can be played by anyone, my main target audience are:  
- Kids from the age 7 to 12.  
- Teenagers from the age 13 to 18.  

## Project Description - Why Make a Sandwich Simulator Game?  

I chose to make a sandwich simulator game for my project since I have always enjoyed playing restaurant simulation games when I was little. In fact, even now, I still enjoy a lot of restaurant simulator games such as **Overcooked 2**. Consequently, I want to make my project around the idea of restaurant simulator games out of passion and my life for the genre.
