# Sandwich Maker Game Project 

## Project Description - What is my Project?    

Hello and welcome to my Sandwich Maker Game. This project will be about a game where you work as an employee at a sandwich restaurant. The gameplay will involve the player first buying a set amount of ingredients for the sandwiches before they open shop. Afterwards, they are tasked with serving 5 customers with their sandwiches of desire. If they are able to serve the 5 customers with the ingredients they bought, then they are able to proceed into the next day and continue the game. However, if they are unable to server all 5 costumers, they will get fired from their job and lose the game as a result.  

## Project Description - Who Will Use my Project?  

Although my project can be played by anyone, my main target audience are:  
- Kids from the age 7 to 12.  
- Teenagers from the age 13 to 18.  

## Project Description - Why Make a Sandwich Simulator Game?  

I chose to make a sandwich simulator game for my project since I have always enjoyed playing restaurant simulation games when I was little. In fact, even now, I still enjoy a lot of restaurant simulator games such as **Overcooked 2**. Consequently, I want to make my project around the idea of restaurant simulator games out of passion and my life for the genre.
